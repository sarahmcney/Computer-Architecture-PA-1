First, you should rename goldbach_provided.c to goldbach.c by entering:
$ mv goldbach_provided.c goldbach.c

To compile your source code goldbach.c, you can type:
$	gcc -Wall -Werror -fsanitize=address -std=c99 -o goldbach goldbach.c -lm
We've provided several important useful compiler flags.

Alternatively, to build the executable, you can type:
$ make

Once your program is successfully compiled, you can run your program:
$ ./goldbach 7

To use the autograder script to test your program, you can type:
$ ./autograder
or
$ python autograder

We will be using the autograder as you see it here to assign your grade.
You can check if you have accidentally modified your autograder:
$ git diff autograder.py

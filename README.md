# Computer-Architecture-PA-1

**This was the first project assigned in Rutgers 01:198:211 (Computer Architecture).

In this project, I gained experience programming in C while reviewing data structures and algorithms. Below you can find a description of each folder of the programming assignment.

- goldbach: Goldbach's weak conjecture
    - Demonstrates Goldbach's weak conjecture, which states that every odd number greater than 5 is the sum of three primes. The program takes an odd number greater than 5 as a command line argument, and outputs a valid equation showing that the given number is the sum of three primes.
- maximum: Finding the N maximum elements of a list
    - Returns the largest elements of a list of signed integers. The program takes the path to an input file as a command line argument. The first line of this text file says how many numbers will be in the list. The second line of this text file says how many of the largest elements you should return. The third line is a list of positive and negative integers from which you should select the largest numbers. The program prints the list of hte largest numbers in any order, separated by spaces.
- matMul: Matrix multiplication
    - Takes two command line inputs, indicating two files to load. The first file contains matrix A and the second file contains matrix B. In both of these input files, the format is such that the first line contains the number of rows in the matrix, and the second line contains the number of columns in the matrix. Then, the file continues for several lines, each line corresponding to a row of the input matrix. In each row, the columns of the matrix are listed, each number separated by a space. The program loads these files and performs matrix multiplication of the two matrices, then outputs L\*N number of numbers reading out the elemnts of the product matrix C in row-major order.
- balanced: Checking if braces are balanced or not using a stack
    - Uses structs and pointers to build a stack data structure, and use that stack to check whether a string of braces is properly balanced. 
- bstReverseOrder: Reverse order traversal of a binary search tree
    - Constructs a binary search tree from a list of input numbers, and then prints out the binary search tree in a reverse order traversal of the tree.
